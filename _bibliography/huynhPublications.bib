	abstract = {This study aims to develop and numerically analyze adaptive balancing domain decomposition by constraints (BDDC) preconditioners for unstructured finite element discretizations of the Bidomain model of electrocardiology on patient-specific ventricular geometries. The Bidomain model, one of the most comprehensive mathematical representations of the cardiac bioelectrical activity, consists of a system of an elliptic and a parabolic partial differential equation of reaction-diffusion type. These equations govern the propagation of electrical potentials in the cardiac tissue. They are strongly coupled with a stiff system of ordinary differential equations that describe the evolution of ionic currents across the cardiac cell membrane. Minimizing the computational cost of simulating this bioelectrical activity requires the development of efficient and scalable preconditioners for the linear systems resulting from the model’s discretization. BDDC preconditioners are nonoverlapping domain decomposition algorithms that consist of the solution of concurrent local problems on each subdomain plus a global coarse problem, whose unknowns are vertex and edge/face average values. Adaptive BDDC preconditioners represent an evolution of standard BDDC methods, where the coarse problem is enriched by adding further constraints obtained by solving suitable generalized eigenvalue problems on subdomain edges and faces. The novelty of the present study is to analyze the effectiveness of such adaptive BDDC methods for unstructured finite element discretizations of the Bidomain model on patient-specific left ventricular geometries, using modern high-performance computing parallel architectures. Different refined left ventricular meshes were generated, each incorporating fiber data. The results highlight the efficiency and accuracy of the implemented preconditioners, confirming their optimality and scalability on CPUs architectures.}

We prove that the resulting preconditioned operator for the solution of the discrete system arising at each time step converges with a scalable and quasi-optimal upper bound for the condition number. The GDSW preconditioner is then applied to the EMI (Extracellular - Membrane - Intracellular) reaction-diffusion system, recently proposed to model microscopically the spatiotemporal evolution of cardiac bioelectrical potentials. Numerical tests validate the scalability and quasi-optimality of the EMI-GDSW preconditioner, and investigate its robustness with respect to the time-step size as well as jumps in the diffusion coefficients.}

	abstract ={In this work, we study the convergence and performance of nonlinear solvers for the Bidomain equations after decoupling the ordinary and partial differential equations of the cardiac system. Firstly, we provide a rigorous proof of the global convergence of Quasi-Newton methods, such as BFGS, and nonlinear Conjugate-Gradient methods, such as Fletcher-Reeves, for the Bidomain system, by analyzing an auxiliary variational problem under physically reasonable hypotheses. Secondly, we compare several nonlinear Bidomain solvers in terms of execution time, robustness with respect to the data and parallel scalability. Our findings indicate that Quasi-Newton methods are the best choice for nonlinear Bidomain systems, since they exhibit faster convergence rates compared to standard Newton-Krylov methods, while maintaining robustness and scalability. Furthermore, first-order methods also demonstrate competitiveness and serve as a viable alternative, particularly for matrix-free implementations that are well-suited for GPU computing.}

	abstract ={We propose here a convergence analysis for virtual element discretizations of the cardiac Bidomain model, a degenerate system of parabolic reaction-diffusion equations that models the propagation of the electric signal in the cardiac tissue. The virtual element method is a recent numerical technology that generalizes finite elements by considering polytopal computational grids, thus allowing more flexibility and accuracy in approximating complex computational domains. This can be an advantage when modeling for instance damaged cardiac tissues or structural heterogeneities. A previous similar study was performed in Anaya et al. (IMA J Numer Anal 40(2):1544-1576, 2020), where the propagation was modeled by means of a scalar nonlocal FitzHugh-Nagumo reaction-diffusion model. In the present work, we extend this analysis to the full semi-discrete Bidomain system, providing extensive numerical tests that validate the theoretical result on several structured and unstructured meshes.}

	abstract ={A balancing domain decomposition by constraints (BDDC) preconditioner is constructed and analyzed for the solution of composite discontinuous Galerkin discretizations of reaction-diffusion systems of ordinary and partial differential equations arising in cardiac cell-by-cell models. The latter are different from the classical bidomain and monodomain cardiac models based on homogenized descriptions of the cardiac tissue at the macroscopic level, and therefore they allow the representation of individual cardiac cells, cell aggregates, damaged tissues, and nonuniform distributions of ion channels on the cell membrane. The resulting discrete cell-by-cell models have discontinuous global solutions across the cell boundaries, and hence the proposed BDDC preconditioner is based on appropriate dual and primal spaces with additional constraints which transfer information between cells (subdomains) without influencing the overall discontinuity of the global solution. A scalable convergence rate bound is proved for the resulting BDDC cell-by-cell preconditioned operator, while numerical tests validate this bound and investigate its dependence on the discretization parameters.}

	abstract  ={The focus of this work is to provide an extensive numerical study of the parallel efficiency and robustness of a staggered dual-primal Newton-Krylov deluxe solver for implicit time discretizations of the Bidomain model. This model describes the propagation of the electrical impulse in the cardiac tissue, by means of a system of parabolic reaction-diffusion partial differential equations. This system is coupled to a system of ordinary differential equations, modeling the ionic currents dynamics. A staggered approach is employed for the solution of a fully implicit time discretization of the problem, where the two systems are solved successively. The arising nonlinear algebraic system is solved with a Newton-Krylov approach, preconditioned by a dual-primal Domain Decomposition algorithm in order to improve convergence. The theoretical analysis and numerical validation of this strategy has been carried out in Huynh et al. (SIAM J. Sci. Comput. 44, B224-B249, 2022) considering only simple ionic models. This paper extends this study to include more complex biophysical ionic models, as well as the presence of ischemic regions, described mathematically by heterogeneous diffusion coefficients with possible discontinuities between subregions. The results of several numerical experiments show robustness and scalability of the proposed parallel solver.}

As a result, it not only yields more accurate simulations of cardiac excitation compared to homogenized models but also presents the challenge of solving much larger problems. In this paper, we introduce recent advancements in three key areas: (i) the creation of artificial, yet realistic grids, (ii) efficient higher-order time stepping achieved by combining low-overhead spatial adaptivity on the algebraic level with progressive spectral deferred correction methods, and (iii) substructuring domain decomposition preconditioners tailored to address the complexities of heterogeneous problem structures. The efficiency gains of these proposed methods are demonstrated through numerical results on cardiac meshes of different sizes.}
