I'm a post-doctoral research fellow at the University of Pavia, working on the development of efficient and scalable preconditioners for cardiac electrophysiology at a cellular scale within the [European project MICROCARD](https://microcard.eu/index-en.html).

Besides my daily desk time, I try to actively promote initiatives among young researchers, aiming to build a fruitful network for the next generation of scientists.

I have organized first-hand three young international workshops, focusing on [cardiac modeling](https://mate.unipv.it/workshop-young-cardiac/) as well as more generic industrial applications ([2022](https://mate.unipv.it/matcomp22/), [2023](https://mate.unipv.it/matcomp23/) and [2024](https://sites.google.com/universitadipavia.it/compmat-spring-workshop/compmat-2024?authuser=0)).

During my doctoral training, I had the opportunity to coordinate [PhD informal seminars](https://euler.unipv.it/seminaridott/) and to take part in bigger organizations such as the VPHi PhD student committee, organizing and chairing [online webinars](https://www.vph-institute.org/webinar.html).
