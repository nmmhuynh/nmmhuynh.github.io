I am a Research Fellow (_contrattista di ricerca_) at the **University of Milan**.

My research interests are in **numerical analysis and scientific computing**, with a focus on **scalable and parallel solvers** for applications in computational cardiology and related multiphysics problems.

### Research interests
- [Domain Decomposition](https://www.ddm.org/) and multigrid preconditioners
- Computational cardiac electrophysiology
- [Virtual element methods](https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/vemwebsite/home-page?authuser=0) and is application to cardiac electrophysiology models
- Finite element analysis of mixed formulation of the generalized porous media equation

I am also actively involved in initiatives for early-career researchers, with the aim of fostering collaboration and building a strong international network.

I have organized several international workshops for young researchers, focusing on _[cardiac modeling](https://mate.unipv.it/workshop-young-cardiac/)_ and on broader topics in _industrial and applied mathematics_ ([2022](https://mate.unipv.it/matcomp22/), [2023](https://mate.unipv.it/matcomp23/), [2024](https://sites.google.com/universitadipavia.it/compmat-spring-workshop/compmat-2024?authuser=0)).
The latest event was the _[Intensive Summer School on Computational Cardiology](https://sites.google.com/view/isscc)_.

##### NEW PAPER OUT!
Our latest paper on the analysis of a [3D BDDC preconditioner for the cardiac EMI model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07722) has been accepted on SIAM Journal of Scientific Computing!

##### MEET ME AT THE UPCOMING CONFERENCES:
1. International Workshop on Numerical and Learning methods for PDEs. February 9-13, 2026, Sanya (China).
2. [WCCM-ECCOMAS 2026](https://wccm-eccomas2026.org/). July 19-24, 2026, Munich (Germany).
