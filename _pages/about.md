I'm a research fellow (_contrattista di ricerca_) at the University of Milan. 

My research primarly focuses on the development of scalable and parallel solvers for application in computational cardiology, and recently I've started to collaborate also on [virtual element discretizations](https://sites.google.com/unimib.it/vemwebsite/home-page?authuser=0) and on numerical schemes for poroelasticity equations -- still both work in progress!

Previously, I've been a post-doctoral fellow at the University of Pavia, working on the development of efficient and scalable preconditioners for cardiac electrophysiology at a cellular scale within the [European project MICROCARD](https://microcard.eu/index-en.html).

Besides my daily desk time, I try to actively promote initiatives among young researchers, aiming to build a fruitful network for the next generation of scientists.

I have organized first-hand four young international workshops, focusing on [cardiac modeling](https://mate.unipv.it/workshop-young-cardiac/) as well as more generic industrial applications ([2022](https://mate.unipv.it/matcomp22/), [2023](https://mate.unipv.it/matcomp23/) and [2024](https://sites.google.com/universitadipavia.it/compmat-spring-workshop/compmat-2024?authuser=0)).
Recently, we have organized an [Intensive Summer School on Computational Cardiology](https://sites.google.com/view/isscc), where we gathered young and senior researchers from a very broad range of fields -- mathematics, computer science, engineering and biology!

##### NEW PAPER OUT!
Our latest paper on [Adaptive BDDC solver for unstructured left ventricular mesh](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0045782525006383) is now out on Computer Methods in Applied Mechanics and Engineering!
<br>
Check also our preprint with the analysis of a [3D BDDC preconditioner for the cardiac EMI model](http://arxiv.org/abs/2502.07722).

##### MEET ME AT THE UPCOMING CONFERENCES:
1. [WCCM-ECCOMAS 2026](https://wccm-eccomas2026.org/). July 19-24, 2026, Munich (Germany).
